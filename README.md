# SpotifyAppIdea

This is a repo dedicated to my creation of a 'Social Network' Media Outlet.

I want to clients upload their own spotfiy data so I can create a 'Map' of the Music

Some simple ideas that I want to breathe to life are
- Create a playlist of songs X amount of people that are 'Saved'
- Create a 'visual' map to to gain more information about someone like...
- Create playlists tailored to each client
  - Most listened to Song
  - Most listened to Artist
  - What 'Mood' they were in an any given amount of time: Day, Week. Month, Year
- Make friends and allow people to 'Discover' other people
  - Discover friend's most listened to songs/artists
- Allow people to 'choose' a favorite song of: Day, Week, Month


Possible Ideas I don't know/think aren't possible
- Stream Data consistenty to let people know what they're friends are listening to
- Get data of each day to analyze
- Notify friends when a new song is added to a collabrotive playlist
