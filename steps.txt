How shall I relate the tables 'StreamingHistory' & 'Users' in SpotifyData.db?

Streaming History has 7 columns per row. That means 7 different values in a record. In this case, we are keeping track of: id, user, fileID, endTime, artistName, trackName, msPLayed

Check DataBase for the normalization
	First Normal Form Rules:
	- each table cell contains a single value
	- each record needs to be unique

	Second Normal Form Rules:
	- follow 1NF
	- Single column primsry key

	Third Normal Form Rules:
	- Be in 2NF
	- Have no transitivefunctional dependencies
